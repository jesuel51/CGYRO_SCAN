# CGYRO_SCAN
CGYRO OMFIT module. This CGYRO scan module can perform both 1D and 2D linear scan.
Since CGYRO is requires intense computational resources, for a typical 2D run, one recommendation is to use at lease 48 cores.
There is no GUI for this module, the template project for 1D and 2D scan at kuafu are:

2D: /scratch/xiangjian/OMFITdata/gapro/ITER_Joey_grid9sBetaE_ESEM2D_cont.zip
